## Overview

The spread of viral political information on social media websites like Facebook has become increasingly problematic, contributing to __widespread misinformation__, polarization, while __capitalizing on the anger and fear__ that these posts incite. While a number of tools exist already or are in development to help users to identify fake, biased, or untruthful information, very few target the emotional dimension of information sharing online. __“Please Make Me Think”__ is a project that seeks to use reflection and mindfulness to help individuals pause in the moment before posting to assess whether they truly want to engage in that way.

## Why do people share misinformation on social media?

The way political information circulates online contributes to global distress (i.e. security, safety, emotional impact, community health, climate distress, etc.). We have identified critical thinking as a key element, in particular the way __emotions affect our ability to think critically when evaluating political information__. By eliciting emotional mindfulness through the user's flow of posting, we intend to disrupt users' patterns of emotional posting.
