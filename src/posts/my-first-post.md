So, you’re an artist working on your website. 

You don’t have to learn or understand all the web design terms and techniques to make a website to share your work and what matters to you.
When I was making my first artist portfolio site (and second, and third…), I felt super overwhelmed and confused by the information I found online. Questions that could have been answered simply, often became massive and scary.

First off, here’s some links to some free resources to improve accessibility:
- For checking colour contrast:  [https://colorable.jxnblk.com/](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/)  
- For checking font sizes and line height: [Fontanello – because you have a weak spot for fonts](https://fontanello.app/)
- For in-depth web accessibility testing :  [https://wave.webaim.org/](https://wave.webaim.org/)  
- For checking your website’s environmental impact: [Website Carbon Calculator | How is your website impacting the planet?](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)

## What does “accessibility” even mean for websites?
Accessibility means taking steps to identify and eliminate barriers that people might have in accessing your website.

The barriers covered in this article include: language, color, font size, image optimization, and optimizing for screen readers.

If you want a more thorough definition of web accessibility, check out the  [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) .

## Know your intention
What do you hope will happen as a result of making your website? 

Knowing the purpose of your site will help you make decisions more easily. If this kind of question feels overwhelming, here’s some ideas:

* My website will help me get into my dream school.
* My website will help me get grant funding to start an artist-run center.
* My website will help me connect and collaborate with other artists.

## Define your community of focus
Who is involved in bringing your intention to reality?

That’s who your website is speaking to.

Clearly define their goals and constraints. If you know someone who has lived experience in your community of focus, see if they’d be available to chat with you about artist websites. Ask them what’s helpful for them to see.

- ****Who are they? 
	- i.e art admins on a board at a residency space, a department admin or hiring manager at a university, etc.
* Why are they on their site?
	* i.e. your site was linked in your CV
* What is their goal?
	* i.e find the perfect residency artist or professor
* What will help them to know if you are the right fit or not?
	* i.e. clear demonstration of your values to see if they align or not
* How much time do they have to look at your site?
	* If you expect they only have 30–60 seconds to scan through the websites of each artist/curator/educator in their list of applications, then plan for that. Make your shit stand out by being super clear and scannable.

Having an idea of what your community of focus *really*needs to know about you and your art practice will help you to know how to structure your content (writing and images).

## Size matters
Tips for making your site feel faster and more scannable.

### Image size
* Optimize your images and try not to upload any images larger than 1MB.
* You can use a tool like this:  [https://imagecompressor.com/](https://imagecompressor.com/) . You can also search on Ecosia for ‘web image optimization’ for more info on what it means and what it does.

###  Use headings (i.e. H1, H2, H3, H4)
Using information ‘hierarchy’ doesn’t make you authoritarian

	* Biggest (H1) is the most memorable and important and also determines what keywords will be linked with your site in search engines.
	* Headings help your website visitors to distinguish groupings and importance.
	* Use no more than one H1 on each page, and use it to communicate the key thing you want the person visiting your site to remember. 

### Minimum 16px font for body copy
(i.e. the main text on a page) on both desktop and mobile. It can be less for small labels and things.
* Why?
	* It takes more cognitive energy to read smaller text. People have been trained to skim quickly. Make it easier for them to do that.

### Increase your line height
Line height is the amount of vertical space between each line of text.
Aim to set your line height to a ratio between 1.2-1.5 (120-150%).

* Why?
	* Spacious line height just feels easier to read. 

### Keep line length between 45–75 characters per line

* Why?
	* It feels more clean and easier to read, therefore it makes people more likely to read it.
	* Compare these two articles:
		1.  [73 characters per line](https://medium.com/greater-good-studio/design-educations-big-gap-understanding-the-role-of-power-1ee1756b7f08) , 21px serif font, 1.524 line height
		2.  [100 characters per line](https://communityrule.info/guides/mutual-aid/) , 20px sans-seri font, 1.5 line height
		* Which one feels more comfortable to read?
* How to do it?
	* Copy paste a sentence from your website into  [lettercount.com](http://lettercount.com/)  and backspace until it’s between 45–75 characters. Choose a cutoff point that feels good.
	* Go into your website editor and adjust your margins/padding/spacers/max-width to keep you within that range.

## Alt Tags and Title Tags
For images and links on your website, you can add additional text that explains what each image or link depicts or does. This provides support for people using screen readers, as well as a back-up in case your images don’t load for someone accessing your site with a slow internet connection.

Here are some articles that go in depth about best practices for writing alt and title tags: [WebAIM: Alternative Text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/), [Alt Text for Images — Examples & 2021 Best Practices - Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text)
